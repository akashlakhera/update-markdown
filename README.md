# update-markdown
> Updates part of existing markdown document

```
npm install -g update-markdown
```
If a file `filename.md` exists with the following contents

```
# title
some text
## foo
this is foo
## bar
this is bar
```
and another file `new.md` with new text for section `## foo` we can replace it using

```
cat new.md | um filename.md "## foo"
```
updating the `filename.md` to have

```
# title
some text
## foo
<content from new.md>
## bar
this is bar
```
You can also specify new content from another markdown file, same command as above will be

```
um filename.md "## foo" new.md
```
